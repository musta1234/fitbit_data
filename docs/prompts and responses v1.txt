I have a data set of daily sleep duration in minutes for the past year.
Can you suggest 10 exploratory analyses and ten testable hypotheses?


### **Exploratory Analyses:**
1. **Summary Statistics:** Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, and range of daily sleep duration to understand the central tendency and variability
2. **Sleep Distribution:** Plot the distribution of daily sleep duration (e.g., histogram or kernel density estimate) to visualize the overall pattern.
3. **Sleep Trends Over Time:** Create a time series plot of daily sleep duration to examine any trends or seasonality across the year.
4. **Monthly Averages:** Calculate and plot the average sleep duration per month to observe any seasonal variations.
5. **Weekday vs. Weekend Sleep:** Compare sleep duration between weekdays and weekends using boxplots or bar plots.
6. **Sleep Consistency:** Calculate the coefficient of variation or other measures of sleep consistency across different weeks or months.
7. **Sleep Patterns by Day of the Week:** Plot average sleep duration for each day of the week to identify potential weekday vs. weekend effects.
8. **Cumulative Sleep Deficit:** Calculate the cumulative sleep deficit (e.g., sleep duration < 7 hours per night) over time to assess sleep deprivation.
9. **Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality Correlation:** If you have sleep quality scores (e.g., self-reported or from a device), explore the relationship between sleep duration and quality.
10. **Outlier Detection:** Identify any significant outliers or irregular sleep days (e.g., very long or very short sleep) and analyze their potential causes.

### **Testable Hypotheses:**
1. **H0: There is no significant difference in average sleep duration between weekdays and weekends.**
2. **H0: The average sleep duration does not significantly change across different months of the year.**
3. **H0: There is no linear trend in sleep duration over the course of the year.**
4. **H0: Sleep duration is not significantly correlated with a person's mood or productivity (if additional mood/productivity data is available).**
5. **H0: Individuals get, on average, at least 7 hours of sleep per night.**
6. **H0: Sleep duration is independent of the day of the week (no significant difference in sleep duration across days).**
7. **H0: There is no significant difference in sleep variability (standard deviation) between weekdays and weekends.**
8. **H0: There is no significant difference in sleep duration between summer and winter months.**
9. **H0: Sleep deficit does not accumulate over time (e.g., no significant trend in cumulative sleep deficit).**
10. **H0: Sleep duration is not significantly correlated with physical activity levels (if data on physical activity is available).**

These analyses and hypotheses provide a comprehensive way to explore the data and test different factors that may affect sleep duration.
